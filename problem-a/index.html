            About the fictional character
        </h2>
        <p>
            Tyrion Lannister is a fictional character from the world popular HBO series, <cite><a href="https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones</a></cite>, and he is the youngest child of Lord Tywin Lannister and younger brother of
            queen Cersei and er Jaime Lannister. He is a witty dwarf and he uses his intellect to overcome the prejudices and obstacles he faces in life. Even though he belongs to the house Lannister
            of Casterly Rock, one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the fictional continent of Westeros, he is often not taken seriously, and he soothes 
            these problems with wine, wit and self-indulgences.

        <h2>
            3 Reasons why I admire this character:
        </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                    Through the series tyrion faces a lot of stereotypes for being a dwarf, and suffers through emotional abuse from the
                    people he looked up to the most, and
                    from his own family. He was hated for being born dwarf, and was not accepted by his own family. People accused him for
                    crimes he did not commit and called
                    him a "monster". Despite all of it, he still manages to be kind and considerate throughout, and he understands what it
                    is to be an underdog and strives
                    to see a world where underdogs have a say too.   
            </li>
            <li>
                    He is betrayed by many people he loved in the series, and he doesn't have many meaningful relationships, but the few he has, he cherishes them. I love his
                    relationship with Varys and Daenerys.
            </li>
            <li class="important">

                    Tyrion is the wisest character in the show in my opinion. He knew his shortcoming and he also knew how to handle them so
                    they never come in the way of him achieving his goals. I admire his efforts to stay alive, and his politically savvy nature. Tyrion helps Jon Snow
                    embrace his status as a bastard such that it wouldn't hurt him when someone tries to u se it against him.
